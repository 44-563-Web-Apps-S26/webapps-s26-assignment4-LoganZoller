    <h3>Act II</h3>


    <h5>Chorus</h5>
    <p>Of all symposia...etc.

        [Exeunt all but Nicemis, who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia,
        who is dressed as Venus. They take Sillimon's arm and bring him
        down]</p>

    <h5>Sillimon</h5>
    <p>Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
        the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
        make them do their duty, but i can't. Bless their little hearts,
        when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
        wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
        my back on 'em. I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.</p>

    <h5>Pretteia</h5>
    <p>You certainly are a dear old thing.</p>

    <h5>Sillimon</h5>
    <p>She says I'm a dear old thing. Deputy Venus says I'm a
        dear old thing.</p>

    <h5>Nicemis</h5>
    <p>It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
        terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
        that you are certainly a very dear old thing.</p>

    <h5>Sillimon</h5>
    <p>Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
        who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
        with such deputy divinities.</p>

    <h5>Pretteia</h5>
    <p>Do you know, I'm going to ask you a favour.</p>
